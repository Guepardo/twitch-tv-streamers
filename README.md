# Twitch.tv Streamers

## What is this?
This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) challenge called [Use the Twitchtv JSON API](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api).  

## Where can I see it?
**No link yet because the project is still under construction.**

## User Stories
This challenge consists of the following user stories:  
1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.    
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.  
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.   
4. I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.    

## The API
The [API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs) was made by [Twitch](http://twitch.tv) themselves.
